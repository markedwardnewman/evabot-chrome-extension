# chrome.extension.evabot
### Notes
- **Need Evabot API info!**
- See **[here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)** for how to install a dev / local version of a chrome extension
- See **[here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)** for testing RESTful API JSON data using a local server
- So far, most of what you see are components that still need to be fit together. Need to meet and discuss.
